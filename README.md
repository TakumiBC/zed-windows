This repository uses GitHub Actions to automatically fetch code from https://github.com/zed-industries/zed and compile a Windows version of [Zed](https://zed.dev/).

## Purpose

I don't understand why Zed Industries dosen't release it's own Windows binary. Though it isn't complicated to compile, however this might be a big challenge for beginners.

It is unclear why Zed Industries doesn't release its own Windows binary. While compiling the code is not complicated, it can be a significant challenge for beginners and it takes up a significant amount of time.



## Download

Go to [Releases](https://github.com/TakumiBC/zed-windows/releases) and download the latest version of `zed_setup.exe`. Run `zed_setup.exe` on your Windows computer and follow the instructions from the setup wizard. Afterwards, you should be able to run Zed.
