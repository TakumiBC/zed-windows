  <h1>Zed Windows</h1>

This project is broken and no longer maintained. Use https://github.com/deevus/zed-windows-builds instead.
~~This repository uses GitHub Actions to automatically fetch code from https://github.com/zed-industries/zed and compile a Windows version of [Zed](https://zed.dev/).~~

## ~~Purpose~~
~~It is unclear why Zed Industries doesn't release its own Windows binary. While compiling the code is not complicated, it can be a significant challenge for beginners and it takes up a significant amount of time. I found it rather unfriendly that I had to compile the code when I just wanted to give Zed a try.~~

## ~~Download~~
~~Go to [Releases](https://github.com/TakumiBC/zed-windows/releases) and download the latest version of `zed_setup.exe`. Run `zed_setup.exe` on your Windows computer and follow the instructions from the setup wizard. Afterwards, you should be able to run Zed.~~
