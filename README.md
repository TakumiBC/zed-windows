This repository uses GitHub Actions to automatically fetch code from https://github.com/zed-industries/zed and compile a Windows version of [Zed](https://zed.dev/).

## Purpose

I don't understand why Zed Industries dosen't release it's own Windows binary. Though it isn't complicated to compile, however this might be a big challenge for beginners.

## Download

Go to [Releases](https://github.com/TakumiBC/zed-windows/releases) and download the latest version of `zed.exe`. Run it on your Windows computer and it should start to operate.
